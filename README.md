# JHRank

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ailov99/JHRank.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ailov99/JHRank.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This project hosts (often overengineered) HackerRank solutions in Julia. It comes with a test suite and a module structure.

* Why Julia? - To learn
* Why HackerRank? - Leetcode still doesn't support Julia. Kattis doesn't seem to account for the 1st Julia code run being slower due to compilation, which often fails performance metrics.

### To run tests:
1. Go to base dir
2. Enter the Julia REPL
3. Go package mode by pressing ']'
4. Activate the package env via 'activate .'
5. Run 'test'
