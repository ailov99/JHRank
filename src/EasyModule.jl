'Beautiful Days at the movies'
Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, 
given the number 12, its reverse is 21. Their difference is 9. The number 120 reversed is 21, and their difference is 99.
She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.
Given a range of numbered days, [i..j] and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as 
numbers where |i - reverse(i)| is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful 
days in the range.

- `i` = the starting day number

    cutTheSticks(arr::Array{Int32})::Array{Int32}

You are given a number of sticks of varying lengths. You will iteratively cut 
the sticks into smaller sticks, discarding the shortest pieces until there are none left. 
At each iteration you will determine the length of the shortest stick remaining, cut that 
length from each of the longer sticks and then discard all the pieces of that shortest length. 
When all the remaining sticks are the same length, they cannot be shortened so discard them.
Given the lengths of n sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each iteration 
until there are none left.

John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers. 
One rotation operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all 
remaining elements right one. To test Sherlock's abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with 
an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the rotation operation a number of times then 
determine the value of the element at a given position.
For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the values of the 
elements at the given indices.

# Arguments
- `a` = The array to rotate
- `k` = Number of rotation to perform on a

Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that 
calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:
- If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
- If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected 
  return date, fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late).
- If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected 
  return date, the fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late).
- If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of  10_000 Hackos.
Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, 
if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be 10_000 Hackos.
